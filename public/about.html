<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a college student pursuing my bachelors in Human Systems Engineering to become a UI designer. What got me into UI
  design was how much I realized how much appearance can leave an impact on your everyday decision making, big or small. For example, choosing
  a house, decorating your house, what apps you'd use on a daily basis, what coffee shop you like and will come back to, etc. My hobbies include
 interrior design, redesigning furniture, puzzles, and watching movies.</p>
